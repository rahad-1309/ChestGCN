# ChestGCN
This repository implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model incorporating a graph convolution layer for tasks like node classification, graph classification, or link prediction on graph-structured data. The graph convolution layer effectively aggregates information from neighboring nodes in the graph, enabling the model to capture the inherent relationships within the data.

Key Features:

Graph Convolution Layer: Leverages the power of graph convolutions to learn node representations that consider the context of neighboring nodes.
Flexibility: Can be adapted to various GNN architectures (e.g., GCN, GAT, etc.) by modifying the model definition.
Scalability: Designed to handle graphs of different sizes, making it suitable for real-world applications.
Customizable: Allows for easy experimentation with hyperparameters and model configurations.
